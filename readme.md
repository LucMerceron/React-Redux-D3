A simple example on how D3 can be used with a classic React web application stack (React Router, Redux, webpack).

## Features

* All the power of D3 with animations and transitions.
* A special care for the responsiveness of the application.
* A refresh button to update data (random) and see transitions

## Install

```
$ npm install
```

## Usage

```
$ npm run build   Build the bundle
$ npm run watch   Build the bundle and watch for modification
$ npm start       Start the server (port 8080)
